        <p>
        Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Munaza Hazrati</strong>, a passionate Full-Stack Developer originally 
        from Afghanistan and currently based in Pakistan.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated from the <strong>Fundamentals of Full-Stack Engineering Career Path</strong> at Codecademy, a program offered by Tech Transition with financial support from the World Bank.

        In 2025, I expanded my journey by joining the <strong>CodeWeekend Bootcamp</strong>, 
        sharpening my skills in React, Node.js, databases, and modern web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My philosophy is simple: <em>Coding Forever,</em> keep learning, keep building.
      </p>
